Project Description

This project is developed for cs319. IQ Puzzler Pro is a board game which improves players intellegance. It is beneficial especially for children in terms of consantration skill. This game appeals up to 6 to adult. Our aim is adapting original IQPuzzlerPro board game to digital platform. In our version, just like the original game, we have two boards and 12 puzzle pieces in different shape and colors. The goal of each level is to fit each of the puzzle pieces together onto these boards as a grid for 2D game version. Also it can be played in 3D by creating pyramids. In each level we give some of the pieces on their correct places and we expect from user to fill the blanks with remaining pieces. At the first level, user can't access the other levels and when the user pass the level, the next level will be unlock. In each level, the difficulty level will be increase and given piece number will be decrease. In our version, if the user can comlete the level in a specific time he/she will earn coin and these coins can be used to get a hint. In addition, there will be a multiplayer option of the game. In this option, users select difficulty level easy, medium and hard. Then, both users will player the same level in order. The game will record time of players and compare them. The player who complete the level in a shorter time will be the winner.
